                    <p>
                        Sonwabile is an aspiration to all who get the chance to work with him and on top of that he maintains a certain level of humanity and poise about his that puts everyone at ease.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sonwabile Gingqishe, also known as Immortal Soso is a South African Screen and Theatre Actor, Spoken Word Artist, Commercial and Fitness Model. He is a perfect example of rising from grass to grace as he rose from an average kid to an international stage actor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They usually say success sometimes must be dreamt and wished before it comes. The actor and model always wanted to be famous and always desired to change the lifestyle of his family. Having been born and raised in Eastern Cape in a small town called Fort Beaufort, Sonwabile Gingqishe started his career back in 2006 as a street Actor, Poet and a Rapper.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We might look at him now with over 50 awards or when we see him on our TV screens and think he had the easiest life but he had the most difficult childhood as he was raised by his step father. Sonwabile describes his life as the hardest experience he has attained.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2009 Sonwabile started mastering his craft as he was awarded as a Top Overall Actor and youngest English Poet in the district. After such accolades Sonwabile never stopped winning. In 2011 he went far by obtaining 6 awards on MTN Foundation School Awards as a Best Actor and Poet in the district, Provincial and on a nation level. He even went far by being placed 3rd Internationally after his participation at Sentinel Literacy Quarterly Poetry Competition in the U.K.

                    <p>
                        Sonwabile then decided to further his level of education at Oakfields College where he studied Drama, Vocal Studies, Choreography, Business Communications and Small businesses management.
                    </p>

                    <p>

He then received International scholarships from The New York Film Academy and New York Conservatory of Dramatic Arts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After returning back from the U.S Sonwabile worked as an industry professional. He continued working as a full time Actor and Model.

                        As much as many people celebrate Sonwabile Gingqishe, he still remains as the most humble person you can come across with. He says he is not where he wants to be right now but he is going slowly but surely. He always dreams of becoming a full time actor in any of the South African tv soapies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sonwabile Gingqishe’s story is from ashes to glory. He continues all his best by educating aspiring artists who wish to embark on this journey.
He lives by his motto ”If your dreams don't scare you, then they are not big enough”.
